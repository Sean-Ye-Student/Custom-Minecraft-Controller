# Custom-Minecraft-Controller

Introducing a new way to play games. Use the custom device to play games such as Minecraft with more interactivity.

The software and hardware was created during computer engineering class with one of my friends and has many features including,

-Physical controller device that allows a user to move joysticks, push buttons and even jump, to control the character within the game.

-Software that comes with instruction such as controls and how to connect the device to the application.

Physical device uses an Arduino Uno and various hardware components such as joysticks, pushbuttons, ultrasonic sensor, etc.

Software uses Cool Term which is a third party software, a python application to read output from Cool Term and a c++ application to convert the instructions into actions.
